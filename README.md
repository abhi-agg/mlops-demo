## Steps

1. Hello World in Metaflow
2. Adding a machine learning model (tiny)
3. Parallelize the computation to separate machines
4. Add weights and biases for experiment visualization
5. Add integration with BigQuery
6. Add an inference server with Ray-serve
7. Train two models with different hyperparameters and compare them on weights and biases
8. Figure out CI
